### üôã Short bio

Immensely curious computational chemist turned software developer. I am currently finishing my Masters' in
dynamic languages interoperation. I mostly write Python, JavaScript, Scheme and
C (roughly in that order).

My academic and work experience spans the stack from DevOps and sysadmin work (cloud and on-prem)
to full-stack web apps to networking, medical imaging, web scraping, smart
contracts, API reverse-engineering, compilers and interpreters, FFIs,
computational chemistry, LLMs, microcontroller firmware, general/executive consulting, technical expert in litigation etc.

Most of my work is private and not available on this repo.

**I am currently looking for work!**

### üõ†Ô∏è Experience

- **2022‚Äì2025** | Freelancer
  
  Worked on various contracts for clients involving web application development,
  web scraping, API reverse-engineering, data collection, analysis, and
  sanitization for SMBs.

- **2024** | LLM Optimization Lead ‚Äì Early Stage Startup
  
  Worked as a contractor on an LLM optimization and evaluation pipeline.
  Full-stack involvement from cutting-edge prompt engineering to computation
  graph optimizations to JITing prompt optimizers using meta-prompting
  techniques.

- **2023‚Äì2024** | Lecturer ‚Äì Universit√© de Montr√©al
  
  Taught two introductory programming courses to hundreds of students. The
  courses used Python and the codeBoot environment, which I help build and
  maintain.

- **2014‚Äì2023** | Software Developer and Consultant ‚Äì Imagerie des Pionniers
  
  Built business-critical internal and customer-facing full-stack web apps for
  cloud and on-premise deployments. Acted as a consultant for stakeholders and
  decision-makers for procurement, strategy and litigation.

  I have built:

  - An issue tracking and ticketing system for internal use
  - A DICOM image sharing portal for practicioners and patients
  - A web-based appointment scheduler for patients handling over 20 000 appointments a year
  - An SMS-based waiting room management system to contact patients just-in-time for their exam handling hundreds of patients daily for over 100 000 interactions per year

- **2016** | Technical Support Specialist / Software Developer ‚Äì La Presse
  
  Built Apple device monitoring and reporting system using Apple Profile
  Manager. Created dashboards for management and tech support using PowerBI.
  Provided general IT support in a high-volume media environment.

- **2013‚Äì2015** | Teaching Assistant ‚Äì Universit√© de Montr√©al
  
  Assisted in teaching multiple undergraduate chemistry courses.

### ‚öôÔ∏è A few projects

No particular order or categorization.

- **py2js** ‚Äì Python to JavaScript Compiler
  
  Wrote a compiler targeting a subset of Python 3. Used in production as part of
  the codeBoot project, a web-based Python IDE for teaching.

- **pyinterp** ‚Äì CPS-Style Python Interpreter in Python
  
  Implemented the FFI layer and some builtins, critical to codeBoot‚Äôs backend.
  The FFI integrates ideas from my research into a production system.

- **codeBoot on Microcontrollers**
  
  Implemented WebSerial communication between codeBoot and MicroPython. Migrated
  environments to Docker for higher reliability and reproducibility. Handled
  firmware build automation and WebSocket bug fixes. Developed a
  high-performance firmware proof-of-concept for ESP32C3 using ESP-IDF.

- **Ribbit Scheme**

  Implemented the Ribbit VM in Haskell. Built classical source-to-source
  transformations (e.g., closure conversion) into the compiler. Bootstrapped an
  x86-64 backend. Worked on porting Racket‚Äôs ‚Äúsets-of-scopes‚Äù expander to
  Ribbit.

- **Gambit Scheme**
  
  Extended Gambit‚Äôs infix reader for JavaScript and Python syntax. Built an
  interface between Gambit Scheme and CPython. Built an interface between Gambit
  Scheme and JavaScript.

- **jsrna** ‚Äì JavaScript RNA Base Pair Annotation
  
  Web-based RNA base-pair annotator/viewer, using a ResNet-based transfer
  learning model. Reformulated as a classification task (similar to MNIST).
  Novel, highly efficient and accurate method yet unpublished.

- **2023 DIRO Hackathon**
  
  Helped organize the Universit√© de Montr√©al‚Äôs 2023 DIRO Hackathon.
  Participants built games using the codeBoot platform to run isomorphically on
  the browser and an ESP32-based board.

- **CLA** ‚Äì Article Reading Club
  
  Organized a scientific article reading club for compiler and programming
  language theory groups. Also hosted a CTF for the group.

- **Ethereum transaction graph explorer**

  Back when these things were rare, I built an Ethereum transaction graph
  explorer using Neo4j. I used this to find evidence of wrongdoing in some
  personal investments. The chain doesn't lie.
  
- **Making EVM smart contracts lie**

  Wrote a PoC EVM smart contract on the **testnet** to exploit out-of-band
  problems on a major chain explorer which resulted in spoofed token metadata,
  misguiding potential investors.
